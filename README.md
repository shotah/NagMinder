A playful on-page **nag bar** that tracks how long you've been on social sites and nudges you with cheeky reminders.

**What you get**

- Time on current site **Today / This Week / This Month / This Year / All Time**
- A persistent **bar at the top** of social pages
- **Funny nag lines** that rotate while you browse
- **Snooze 15m** and **Pause Today** buttons
- Configurable domains, tick interval, and snooze time via **Options**

## Quick Start (Load Unpacked)

1. Download the ZIP from your ChatGPT session and unzip it (or clone this repo).
2. Open Chrome ‚Üí `chrome://extensions/`
3. Toggle **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** ‚Üí select the `NagMinder/` folder.
5. Visit a tracked site (e.g., `reddit.com`, `x.com`, `instagram.com`) ‚Äî the Nag bar shows at the top.

> Data: settings sync via `chrome.storage.sync`. Usage time is stored locally via `chrome.storage.local` and never leaves your machine.

---

## How It Works

- A background **service worker** ticks every `tickSeconds` (default 5s).
- If your **active tab** is a tracked domain and you‚Äôre **not idle** (using the `chrome.idle` API, 60s threshold), the extension increments counters for:
  - **day** (resets at midnight local time)
  - **week** (ISO week number, resets on week change)
  - **month** (resets when month changes)
- The **content script** injects a minimal bar at the top and refreshes stats every ~5s.
- Snooze sets a timestamp (no bar until the snooze ends). **Pause Today** hides the bar for the rest of the day.

**Per‚Äësite counters:** When you‚Äôre on `reddit.com`, you see only your `reddit.com` time for today/week/month.

---

## Options

Open `chrome://extensions`, find **NagMinder**, click **Details** ‚Üí **Extension options**.  
You can change:

- ‚úÖ Enable/disable
- üåê Domain list (one per line; subdomains are matched automatically)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Tick interval (seconds; lower = more precise)
- üò¥ Default snooze minutes

You can also **Reset Counters** from the options page (clears local totals and date markers).

## Files

```
NagMinder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json         # MV3 manifest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js         # tracking, storage, messages, date resets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js            # in-page bar, render, snooze/pause

```

## Customization

- **Messages**: edit `messages.js` to add/remove lines.
- **Default domains**: edit `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.domains` in `background.js` (or use Options).
- **Bar design**: tweak `styles.css`. It‚Äôs intentionally small & readable.
- **Granularity**: change `tickSeconds` in Options to `1` for near real‚Äëtime (slightly more CPU).

---

## Privacy

- No analytics. No network requests.
- All usage data stays in **`chrome.storage.local`** on your device.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Bar doesn‚Äôt appear**: Make sure the site‚Äôs root domain is in Options. For example, add `x.com` (Twitter) instead of `twitter.com` if you use the new domain.
- **Still no bar?** Try disabling other extensions that alter page top bars or heavy content blockers that might block `content.js` injection.
- **Service worker asleep**: If the bar shows `--`, give it a few seconds; messaging wakes the worker.
