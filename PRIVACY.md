# Privacy Policy for NagMinder Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

NagMinder is a Chrome extension that helps you track time spent on social media websites. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**NagMinder does NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

### What Data is Stored Locally

NagMinder stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Time tracking data**: Minutes spent on tracked websites (today, week, month, year, all-time)
- **Settings**: Your preferred domains to track, snooze duration, and tracking interval
- **State data**: Last reset dates for daily/weekly/monthly counters, snooze timestamps

### Where Data is Stored

- **Local Storage**: Time tracking data is stored in `chrome.storage.local` on your device
- **Sync Storage**: Settings are optionally stored in `chrome.storage.sync` (Chrome's built-in sync)

All data remains on your device and within Chrome's secure storage system.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties.**

- No analytics services
- No tracking pixels
- No server connections
- No data collection backends

## Chrome Sync (Optional)

If you have Chrome sync enabled, your extension settings (domains, preferences) may sync across your Chrome browsers through Google's secure sync service. This is handled entirely by Chrome, not by NagMinder.

Time tracking data (how long you've spent on sites) is **never synced** and remains local to each device.

## Permissions Explanation

NagMinder requests the following permissions for functionality:

- **storage**: Store time tracking data and settings locally
- **tabs**: Detect which website is currently active for time tracking
- **idle**: Pause tracking when you're away from your computer
- **Host permissions**: Inject the nag bar on specified social media sites only

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

NagMinder does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Data Retention

- Time tracking data is stored until you manually reset it or uninstall the extension
- Settings are stored until you change them or uninstall the extension
- Uninstalling the extension removes all local data

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- **View**: Check your time tracking data in the extension's nag bar
- **Reset**: Clear all time tracking data via the Options page
- **Delete**: Uninstall the extension to remove all data
- **Control**: Configure which sites to track via the Options page

## Children's Privacy

NagMinder does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13, as it collects no personal data from any users.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will:

- Update the "Last Updated" date
- Notify users through the Chrome Web Store update notes
- Continue to maintain our no-data-collection practice
